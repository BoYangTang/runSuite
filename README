runSuite - Automated Batch Program Testing

Usage: ./runSuite suiteFile programPath

Tests are specified as pairs of input (.in) and expected output (.out) files.

suiteFile is the file containing test pair name stems.

programPath is the absolute path to the executable program being tested.

Example:
  
  filename "tests"
  contents:
    test1
    test2
    test3

  program "print"
  path: ./print
  
  command: ./runSuite tests ./print
  
  runs "print" three times, using test1.in, test2.in, test3.in file input and
  compares the output to expected output from test1.out, test2.out, test3.out
  respectively.
